      <p>
        Chess notation are a combination of letters and numbers to keep track of
        chess moves. Today, we use algebraic notation. Every square on the board
        has a notation. The notation has the letter of the file, and the number
        of the rank. In algebraic notation, we also use capital letters for the
        pieces("K" for king, "Q" for queen, "R" for rook, "B" for bishop, and
        "N" for knight). When you capture a piece we use the letter "x".
        Castling short(kingside) is represented by "0-0" and castling
        long(queenside) is represented by "0-0-0". When white wins a game we use
        1-0 and when black wins a game we use 0-1. 1/2-1/2 is when there is a
        draw. If you want a better understanding about chess notation, watch
