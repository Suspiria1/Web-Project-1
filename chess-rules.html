      <!-- list about the rules -->
      <dl>
        <dt>Castling</dt>
        <dd>
          ♘ Castling is used to move your king out of the center from attacks.
          You can do castling for different tactics. In order to castle, you
          must meet all the requirements: You have not moved the king or rook
          once. There are no pieces between the rook and king. The king is not
          in check. A piece is not attacking squares where the king will castle
          and will land. You can castle in either direction.
        </dd>
        <dt>Pawn Promotion</dt>
        <dd>
          ♘ When a pawn reaches the the opposite row of the board, it can turn
          into a knight, bishop, rook or a queen but it cannot promote into
          itself.
        </dd>
        <dt>En Passant</dt>
        <dd>
          ♘ This move is unique and can only be used by pawns. In order to do
          the en passant move, you need to meet all the requirements: The
          opposite pawn is three ranks(rows) away from the rank from its
          starting position, the opposite pawn is on the file(coloumn) beside
          the capturing pawn, you can only capture the pawn right after when the
          pawn moves.
        </dd>
        <dt>Check</dt>
        <dd>
          ♘ Check is when the king is being attacked by another piece. When the
          king is in check, you must move the king out of check. You can also
          use other pieces to block the check if you want.
        </dd>
        <dt>50 Move Rule</dt>
        <dd>
          ♘ The 50 move rule is when both players make 50 moves without
          capturing pieces or moving pawns
