        First of all, chess pieces and a chessboard are required to play chess.
        Chess pieces include: 16 pawns, 4 bishops, 4 knights, 2 rooks, 2 queens
        and 2 kings (the pieces include both white and black).

      <h1>The Chess Board</h1>
      <!-- info -->
      <p>
        A chessboard has 64 squares(8x8) with light and dark squares. When
        setting up the chessboard, the bottom-right corner always has to be a
        light square. Each piece has a value that doesn't affect the game.

        backward and can only capture one square diagonally. The pawn worth 1
